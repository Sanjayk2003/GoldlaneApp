Jewelry Selling Application - UI/UX Design
This project contains the UI/UX designs for a jewelry and ornaments selling application, created using Miro and Figma. The application is aimed at providing a seamless shopping experience for users who want to browse, select, and purchase jewelry online.

**Project Overview**
This design focuses on creating an intuitive and user-friendly interface, allowing users to:

Browse through various categories of jewelry (rings, necklaces, earrings, etc.).
View detailed product pages with high-quality images and descriptions.
Add items to their cart or wishlist.
Complete secure purchases through an easy-to-use checkout process.
Track their orders and view purchase history.
The main objective was to ensure a visually appealing design that reflects the elegance and luxury of the jewelry while maintaining simplicity and usability for the end users.

**Design Workflow**
Brainstorming and Conceptualization: The project began with brainstorming the user experience through Miro. We created mind maps, defined user personas, and mapped out user journeys to identify key touchpoints in the application.

Wireframing: The wireframes were sketched out on Miro to establish a clear structure for each screen. These low-fidelity wireframes focused on the layout, navigation, and user flow.

High-Fidelity Mockups: After wireframes, high-fidelity mockups were developed in Figma. This included a color palette that complements the luxury theme, typography for readability, and interactive elements such as buttons, menus, and hover effects.

Prototyping: Using Figma's prototyping features, we created an interactive prototype, simulating the user experience from browsing to checkout.

**Key Design Decisions**
Color Scheme: A palette that reflects elegance and luxury, with shades of gold, white, and black.
Typography: Chose fonts that balance luxury with readability. Serif fonts for titles and sans-serif fonts for body text.
Visual Hierarchy: Use of large images and bold text for important elements, such as featured products and CTA buttons.
Responsiveness: Designs were created with responsiveness in mind, ensuring a seamless experience across desktop and mobile devices.
